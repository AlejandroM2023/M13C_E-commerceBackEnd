## Installation

  The application must run the application with node js. The user must install the following packages: "dotenv", "express", "pg", and "sequelize". The user then has to make http requests with an application like insomnia.

## Usage

  The user will initialize the application with node npm start to start up the express server. The user will then be able to make calls in applications like insomnia using get, post, put and delete http methods. The user will be able to view all products, tags, and cetegories. The user can indivually query products,tags, and categories with an id in the uri query parameters. The application allows you to do the same with all the CRUD operations so we also have create, delete, and update.
